# Find the basketball 
Goal of this project is to find a basketball ball in an image using classical computer vision methods (without usage of machine learning in any form). 

# Prerequesitions
* boost library 
* opencv library (tested for 4.5.5 CHECK)

#### Methods to be try out also in combination:
 [x] Canny Edge detector (standalone doesn't work well) 
 [ ] HSV Color filtering
 [ ] SIFT keypoints
 [ ] Template matching algorithm

 #### Known problems and reasons why it cannot work as good as using machine learning
 * occlussion
 * same color in the background
